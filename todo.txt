BACKEND:
Add add users section
Add profile section "qui suis je" (maybe, this is extra)

have the search bar remember what you searched or the filter / page you're on when you edit a book?

Make the entire row clickable and not just the edit button on the left, maybe remove the edit button


To add new books to the new coup de coeur, im limited with 9 new books because i don't specify the amount I want, and it is automatically
limited by the API. I need to make sure i'm not limited at 9

Make the search bar work with characters with accents like they didn't have accents or something, and the other way around


You need to be able to add books and edit books from the coup de coeur page, this will be easier if i use a modal
and i just import that modal component onto each page

Make it so when you add a genre in add book backend, the search isn't erased


ajouter un article has to be changed to ajouter un info



Right now ISBN is necessary, it must not be necessary
If someone enters an isbn that exists already, there must be a message that is displayed that says "this isbn exists already, please choose another
or remove it" instead of just getting a server error


Description for coup de coeur should not be obligatoire
Enregistrement should not be obligatoire


There has to be a version of each coup de coeur that is able to be generated for printing purposes

Delete programmation from the dernieres info categories

Make the whole box for the dashboard clickable for navigation

For the books pages, when there is a genre already associated, the bar for "selectionner les genres" should change to "selectionner plus des genres"
to indicate that there is already something associated

Add colors to the genre tags like the type of derniere info tags

Contact section
make the navbar use links and not hrefs to make it faster
