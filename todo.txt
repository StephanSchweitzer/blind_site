BACKEND:
Add add users section
Add profile section "qui suis je" (maybe, this is extra)

have the search bar remember what you searched or the filter / page you're on when you edit a book?

If the user doesn't confirm their audio, and they try to submit a coup de coeur, it should warn them ?

FRONTEND:
Contact section


## POTENTIALLY UNIMPORTANT ## Add colors to the genre tags like the type of derniere info tags

Contact formulaire

## WAITING FURTHER INSTRUCTION ## Rename coups de coeur Nouveau livrs or sortie du mois or something else. To be seen

inscription / adhesion

Mobile version expand description takes the whole screen and you can't close it anymore

Adapt the pdf and add pagination

A form that lets you request books from the book page

"The pattern must match exactly the regex something" in coups de coeur new, If you add an existing book from the page

## MAYBE UNNECESSARY ## If someone adds a book from the google book API and it exists already, maybe show a dialogue warning them "Un livre avec cet ISBN existe deja dans la catalogue. Voulez vous continuer ?"

## UNSURE ## Maybe for new coup de coeur I have to check since last modified date, and not last published date
